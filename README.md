# ECB Attacks
## ECB Attack I
Please proceed to the `ecb-attack` folder.

You will be exploiting the weakness of ECB to inject a range of malicious behaviors into a user's data.

Your first job is to create a user data (which is a compromised copy of the `encrypted.user`) that has set `uid` field to 0 (root). Your job is to edit the `template.py` file (sections marked as `XXX`); running this file will create three user data `flag1.user`, `flag2.user` and `flag3.user`. Once you have a compromised `flag1.user` file, you are ready to run `launcher`. Provide your `flag1.user` to the launcher and choose the option number 1. If you're correct, you will have the flag.

Good luck.

## ECB Attack II
Please proceed to the `ecb-attack` folder.

You will be exploiting the weakness of ECB to inject a range of malicious behaviors into a user's data.

Your first job is to create a user data (which is a compromised copy of the `encrypted.user`) that has set `is_admin` field to 1 (admin). Your job is to edit the `template.py` file (sections marked as `XXX`); running this file will create three user data `flag1.user`, `flag2.user` and `flag3.user`. Once you have a compromised `flag2.user` file, you are ready to run `launcher`. Provide your `flag2.user` to the launcher and choose the option number 2. If you're correct, you will have the flag.

Good luck.

## ECB Attack III
Please proceed to the `ecb-attack` folder.

You will be exploiting the weakness of ECB to inject a range of malicious behaviors into a user's data.

Your first job is to create a user data (which is a compromised copy of the `encrypted.user`) that has set `password` field to any other password (your choice). Your job is to edit the `template.py` file (sections marked as `XXX`); running this file will create three user data `flag1.user`, `flag2.user` and `flag3.user`. Once you have a compromised `flag3.user` file, you are ready to run `launcher`. Provide your `flag3.user` to the launcher and choose the option number 3. If you're correct, you will have the flag.

Good luck.
